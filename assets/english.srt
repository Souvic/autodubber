1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I am in India for the World Cup of Cricket!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yeah!

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
But what is cricket?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Cricket is similar to baseball.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It is the second most popular sport in the world right after football.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Just hear it from cricket legends.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Here in India, cricket is bigger than life.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Companies like DP World are taking cricket international with this container.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Each container has 250 kits, helmets, gloves, bats, everything a kid needs to play cricket.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So more kids try this game and fall in love with it.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Cricket is growing so fast, it may actually become the number one sport in the world.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That's one minute.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
See you tomorrow.
